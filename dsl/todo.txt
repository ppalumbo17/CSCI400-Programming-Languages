Rules files
x	(2) Create at least two "valid" files (e.g., I have JustDoIt and MtnLover in my example execution)
x	(1) Rules files should includes all rules listed at the top of the assignment (may have some in one file, some in the other... and some additional rules, for example like the two membership rules in figure 2)
x	(1) Create a file with a bad action. Name this file badRules.txt.
	You may want to create another rules file for your unit tests. I created a file named simpleRules.txt with only a few products, to simplify testing.
Defining the rules
x	(2) Define at least six types of products (include all products from the example at the top of this assignment, plus others as you desire)
x	(4) Include actions with and without parameters
x	(4) Be able to add rules to a product (like book example)
Main Menu
x	(2) Displays options
x	(2) Ensures valid option is entered 
x	(2) Calls appropriate method or exits program
Loading the rules
x	(5) Prompt the user for the filename. Add a .txt extension if needed.
x	(4) Display an error message (but don't abort) if file does not exist
x	(5) Define the methods needed to load the business rules file (similar to questionsv1.rb)
x	(10) Store the rules in a suitable data structure
x	(5) Abort with appropriate message if loading the rules fails (must use exceptions)
Processing the orders
x	(4) Prompt the user and accept a product
x	(4) Display error message if product not defined (i.e., if no rules were loaded for that product). Program does not abort (like giraffe example in figure 2).
x	(15) If product is defined, display the associated actions
x	(3) Loop ends when sentinel value (e.g., d or D) is entered
Unit tests
	(5) Include a test for loading a simple set of rules
	(3) Include a test for loading rules with a bad action
Execution and Style
	(4) Include sufficient comments
	(3) Include a readme file so the grader can easily determine how to run your program and your unit tests. If your instructions tell the grader to edit your source code for any purpose (e.g., to use a different rule file), there will be a 3-point deduction. You should set up your unit tests so they do not require the entire program to be executed. (hint: make your code more modular; it's good practice!)
